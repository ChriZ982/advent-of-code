# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code :snowman:

Advent of Code solutions for 2023 written in Rust and C++ :rocket:

My goal for this year is to compare Rust with C++ and see in what state the "functional" side of C++ is currently, while trying to write
minimal and somewhat efficient code. The goal is **not** to produce the most readable and robust code.

To run a program, simply `cd` into the directory of the year and run the following command:

```bash
# Rust:
cargo run --package day-1 --bin part1 --release

# C++:
make deps
make day-1-part1
```

Replace the day and part numbers with the ones you would like to run.
