Advent of Code solutions for 2023 written in Rust and C++ :rocket:

To run a program, simply `cd` into the directory of the year and run the following command:

```bash
# Rust:
cargo run --package day-1 --bin part1 --release

# C++:
make deps
make day-1-part1
```

Replace the day and part numbers with the ones you would like to run.
